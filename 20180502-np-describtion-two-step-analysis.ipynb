    "The aim of this notebook is to describe the preparation and execution of the two-step analysis. The two-step analysis was developed specifically in preparation of the SWOT mission. It performs a data assimilation update with an observation vector that is augmented by **gradient observations** and with a corresponding observation error covariance matrix $\\mathbf{R^+}$. The analysis will be run with an implementation of an Ensemble Kalman Filter ([SESAM](http://pp.ige-grenoble.fr/pageperso/brankarj/SESAM/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Ensemble Kalman Filter the pdf of the **state vector** is represented by an ensemble (sample) of members (states). In the two-step analysis the state vector consists of 6 variables all projected on different grids:<br>\n",
    "ssh provided by a numerical model on gridT<br>\n",
    "ssh projected with the SWOT simulator on gridSWOT<br>\n",
    "first derivation along track calculated on gridD1a<br>\n",
    "first derivation across track calculated on gridD1c<br>\n",
    "second derivation along track calculated on gridD2a<br>\n",
    "second derivation across track calculated on gridD2c<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first step we generate an ensemble of numerical model outputs that is afterwards extended by the other variables. For the development of the analysis process and the data preparation tools, a dataset consisting of 474 outputs (with a frequency of one day) from the NATL60 simulation between june 2012 and october 2013 for the OSMOSIS region was provided. In the following, the dataset will be addressed as ```alldata.nc```.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a second step we generate the **observation vector** for the analysis based on the true state of the system. As true state we consider day 100 from the initial dataset. We then extend the observation vector with first and second derivations along and across track."

    "For each member of the ensemble `ENS0060.nc.bas` we use the SWOT simulator to project ssh on a SWOT-like grid.\n",
    "The SWOT simulator was created in preparation of the SWOT mission to simulate SWOT-like observations. To extend the ensemble we only need the projection of the ssh from the model grid on the SWOT-like grid (variable name in the file generated by the simulator: `ssh_model`). For the generation of the R-matrix in section 5 we also need the realization of the expected observation errors (variable name in the file generated by the simulator: `ssh_obs`). For this work, a single SWOT pass (pass 182) that crosses the OSMOSIS region from the northwest corner to the south (center) was chosen to represent the SWOT-like grid and observation. Normally, the simulator generates all passes that cross the input region. To generate only one single pass, we let the simulator generate (almost) all passes and corresponding grids for the first member of the ensemble (see step i - iii below) and then delete all grids except of the one of the desired pass. Following steps v and vi the simulator will then only produce a pass on the provided grid.<br>\n",

This is, because there is no implementation in SESAM to interpolate gradient observations on the model grid (gridT) (= there is no implementation of the observation operator $\\mathbf{H}$ for gradient observations). In the first analysis we are using all five (gradient) observations (ssh, first and second derivation along and across track) and their corresponding R matrixes to perform an update on each grid. The update that is performed on gridT shows an updated area but in a region that is spacially not correlated with the location of the observation. The update that is performed on the observation grid (gridSWOT) is spatially not correlated to the model grid but contains the updated ssh. With a second analysis we then project the updated ssh from gridSWOT on the model grid. We thereby assign a low standard deviation to the observation (here: 0.0001) so that the observation has a high certainty in the analysis. \n",
